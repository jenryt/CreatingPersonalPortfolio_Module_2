# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This website showcases my projects and provides a brief introduction about me. As I continue to grow my knowledge in the field of full stack development, I will update and add more content to this site.

## How to Use

1. Upon loading the page, you will see my name, occupation, and personal photo at the top of the page.
2. On the top right corner of the site, there's a navigation bar that displays a dropdown list when hovered over.
3. The dropdown list provides shortcuts to different topics on the site, such as "About Me," "Works,” and "Contact Me." Clicking on a topic will navigate you to the corresponding part of the site.
4. My projects are listed under "Works,” where you can scroll through and see a brief introduction to each project, along with a link to the project site. For upcoming projects, placeholder images are provided, and a message is displayed when you click on them.
5. At the bottom of the site, you can find my personal contact information, including my email address, LinkedIn page, and GitHub page.
